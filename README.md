R in the Lab: Two Treatments on Multiple Responses
================

A complete R tutorial about how to perform a comparison analysis between
two treatments on multiple responses. This is performed through a
t-Test, summarizing and graphing the data.

Note that I didn’t explain how I simulated the experimental data, but
you can see the code on data\_simulation.R

If you have cloned this repository and want to run this analysis from
scratch first run erase\_all\_outputs.R script and then run Main.R
script o whichever script you want.

The image folder contain images that I’ve used on this presentation: [Two Treatment Comparison on Multiple Responses](https://github.com/jpch26/Two-Treatments-Comparison-on-Multiple-Responses/blob/main/Two%20Treatment%20Comparison%20on%20Multiple%20Responses.md)
